		<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>A salad is a dish consisting of mixed pieces of food, typically with at least one raw ingredient. They are often dressed, and typically served at room temperature or chilled, though some can be served warm.</p>
			<p> Garden salads use a base of leafy greens such as lettuce, arugula/rocket, kale or spinach; they are common enough that the word salad alone often refers specifically to garden salads. Other types include bean salad, tuna salad, fattoush, Greek salad (vegetable-based, but without leafy greens), and s≈çmen salad (a noodle-based salad).</p>
